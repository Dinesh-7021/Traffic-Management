# 🚦 Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) 🚘  

An AI-powered **Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS)** designed to improve road safety, optimize traffic flow, and enforce compliance using **Machine Learning (ML), Computer Vision, and IoT technologies**.  

---

## 📌 Overview  
Urban congestion and traffic violations are major challenges in modern cities. This project leverages advanced **Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Image Processing** to create an **automated, efficient, and scalable** traffic management solution.  

ITMS detects:  
✔ **Helmet Compliance** – Identifies motorcyclists without helmets  
✔ **Traffic Signal Violations** – Detects vehicles crossing red lights  
✔ **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** – Reads and verifies license plates  
✔ **Cell Phone Usage Tracking** – Identifies distracted driving behavior  
✔ **Proximity-based Police Alerts** – Notifies law enforcement in case of violations
